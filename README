nPSF is designed to be a code that returns a likelihood map for the 
relative positions of multiple (n) PSFs in an image. It's goal is to 
provide likelihood information for relative astrometry, e.g., KBO moons.

nPSF is funded by HST-14560.002 on finding the orbit of the moon of 2013 FY27.

Currently in the planning phases, nPSF will be written in julia v1 to 
take advantage of speed and to get me practice working with it. I have 
lots of ideas for bells and whistles, but we'll see how far everything 
gets.
